        <p class="header-p">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of "Youtubability" -<br/> another important game guideline.</p>

<br/>
<p class="c-1">A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.</p>
<br/>

<p class="c-1">Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.</p>
<br/>
<p class="c-1"> Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :</p>
<br/>
<p class="c-1">For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).</p>
<br/>
<p class="c-1">
    Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

    If you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the street, it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.
</p>
<br/>
<p class="c-2"><strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to drawing.</p>

<p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.<strong> You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong></p> 

<br/>

<p>Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.</p>
